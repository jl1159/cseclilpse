Import and Modify a Java Project

Import an Existing Java Project
	1. On the main menu bar, click 'File > Import'
	2. Use the filtered search to locate 'Existing Projects into Workspace' 
	3. Select 'Select root directory' (should be the default), browse to the project's root directory (XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX INSERT PATH XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX), and click 'OK'.
	4. Make sure that the project is selected
	5. Select 'Copy projects into workspace'
	6. Click 'Finish'
		- Don't worry if you see build errors (a red X on the project). Eclipse will take a few seconds to import and build the project/workspace. You can see this progress in the bottom-right corner of the eclipse UI.
	7. Congrats, you've just imported a project!
	
Examine Your Project
	1. You'll see your Java projects in the Package Explorer view. Take some time to browse through the project. Although we'll be spending significant time examining and customizing this view, feel free to take some time to investigate and experiment now. (You can always delete and reimport if you make a mess)
	
Modify Your Project
	- Note: For each of the following exercises, feel free to try more than once - You can always delete packages and files later.
	1. Create a New Package
		i. Use one (or more) methods covered during lecture to create a new package in the cseclipse project. Name the new package "coreservlets.eclipse.myfirstpackage"
	2. Create New Java Classes
		i Use one (or more) methods covered during lecture to create 3 new Java classes in the 'coreservlets.eclipse.myfirstpackage' package. Name the classes 'MyFirstClass', 'MySecondClass', and 'MyThirdClass'.
	3. Experiment with Creating Other File Types
		i. Some commonly used file types include
			- JavaScript (.js)
			- XML (.xml)
			- HTML (.html)
			- CSS (.css)
			- properties (text file, .properties)

Still Have Some Time?
	- Walk through the new project creation process described in the lecture.
